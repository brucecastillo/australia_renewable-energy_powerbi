# Australia Renewable Energy Forecasting

This repository contains my **Power BI project** analyzing and forecasting renewable energy trends in Australia. The project focuses on visualizing historical data, understanding energy contributions, and predicting future trends for various renewable energy sources.  


##  Project Overview

The project explores renewable energy generation in Australia, including:

- **Bagasse wood**  
- **Biogas**  
- **Geothermal**  
- **Hydro**  
- **Solar**  
- **Wind**  

The interactive dashboards allow users to:

- View energy generation **by year**  
- Filter and analyze **by energy scale** (small, medium, large)  
- Compare energy production **by state**  
- **Forecast renewable energy production up to 2030**  
- Compare Australia’s renewable energy trends with **neighboring countries**  
- **Navigate per section:** Press **Alt + Left Click** on any visual to focus on that section  

These dashboards provide insights into historical trends, comparisons, and future projections for Australia's renewable energy sector.
