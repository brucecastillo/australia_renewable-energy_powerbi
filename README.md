Australia Renewable Energy Forecasting

This repository contains my Power BI project analyzing and forecasting renewable energy trends in Australia. The project focuses on visualizing historical data, understanding energy contributions, and predicting future trends for various renewable energy sources.

Project Overview

The project explores renewable energy generation in Australia, including:

Bagasse wood

Biogas

Geothermal

Hydro

Solar

Wind

The interactive dashboards allow users to:

View energy generation by year

Filter and analyze by energy scale (small, medium, large)

Compare energy production by state

Forecast renewable energy production up to 2030

Compare Australia’s renewable energy trends with neighboring countries

Navigate per section: Press Alt + Left Click on any chart or visual to focus on that section

Using historical data, I created interactive visualizations to track trends, compare contributions, and provide actionable insights for future planning.
